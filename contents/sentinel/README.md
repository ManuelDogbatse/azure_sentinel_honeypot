## Creating a workbook in Sentinel

Now that the logs have been collected from the virtual machine, the next step is to visualise the log data in a presentable and meaningful way.

In Azure, go to the 'Microsoft Sentinel' page. Then click the 'law-honeypot' Sentinel instance created in earlier steps. Then go to the 'Workbooks' tab under 'Threat management' and click 'Add Workbook'.
